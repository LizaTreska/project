# 🏛️ Web presentation of the interactive platform "Digital Heritage Laboratory"

## 🌟 About the Project

**HERITAGE** is a student-led project focused on the digital preservation and 3D reconstruction of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed.

This platform serves as a showcase for detailed 3D modeling work, allowing users to interact with digitally restored historical locations and download the source files for educational or archival purposes.

The current featured case is the **National Literary and Memorial Museum of Hryhorii Skovoroda**, which was heavily damaged in May 2022.
